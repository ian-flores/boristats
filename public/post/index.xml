      <description>It is March 12 2020, we are in the middle of a global pandemic of #Coronatime, also known as COVID-19. People have been asked to work from home and you specifically have been asked to teach your in-person lectures/workshops/learning-transfer-rituals online. Now you might be wondering why the light tone of this text? Well, Iâ€™m from Puerto Rico, and TwitterPR has been exploding with memes about the pandemic, so might as well share some of that catastrophic joy with everyone around the globe.</description>
